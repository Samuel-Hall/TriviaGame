***Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Trivia***

The Tony Hawk's Pro Skater (THPS) series is one of my all-time favorite video game series. I've played countles hours of these games since the first one was released. I decided to dedicate this Trivia game to the Neversoft titles that shaped my gaming experience and heavily influenced my taste in music. 

At the core, this is a basic timed trivia game. 
You have two minutes to answer as many questions correctly as possible.
The game ends if you either:
 - Answer all of the available questions
 Or
 - The timer runs out. 

The game has two additional objectives based on the classic THPS games:
 - Collect the letters of S-K-A-T-E, which is achieved by answering 5 questions correctly.
 And
 - Find the hidden tape, which is achieved by answering ALL the questions correctly.
